Seeing if [this](https://twitter.com/Steve_Harborne/status/1133064277445627904) can be binderized?

Simple script for automatically annotating SDS-PAGE images 

## Going beyond the built-in demo gel

To upload your own data, click on the Jupyter logo in the upper left to access a typical file browser that allows file uploads.

Then change `gel_file` assignment to specify your gel name.

(Drag-and-drop is possible with the the JupyterLab interface; however, you'd probably want to switch back after uploading your gel as currently plotting is more reliable in the classic notebook interface. See [here](https://github.com/binder-examples/jupyterlab#start-jupyterlab-after-you-start-your-binder) about switching interfaces.)
